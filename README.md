# TrustFortress

This is an open source effort to establish a foundation of trust in computing that can defeat advanced persistent threats and state actors.

We can achieve global security by working together. They want us to believe it's not possible, don't give in to their manipulation.

## Proposal

1. Memory integrity monitoring
     a. Page table monitoring
     b. Hook detection
     c. In memory polymorphism detection
     b. Rolling cryptographic hashing of memory and executable code to prevent any remote RF or Acoustic based memory manipulation attacks.
2. Behavioral analysis of memory access patterns against known access patterns for known applications
3. Hardware based solutions (TPM, secure boot, Secure enclaves, needs to be thoroughly investigated for state actor tampering obviously)
4. Enhanced logging and monitoring:
    a. Full memory dumps, partial memory dumps, cryptographically collapsed dumps
    b. Access logging to establish behavioral baselines across populations.
5. Anomaly detection (ML/AI based)
6. Developing hardware sensors for advanced attack detection using known attack techniques (ceramic capacitor acoustic microphonics, for example, it should be possible to use the same technique to detect such an attack electronically, we'd just need some capacitors to "examine" periodically).
7. Kernel hardening
     a. New advancements in generative programming techniques, incorporating fully instrumented tests and benchmarks, and then making competitions between humans and AI to provide optimizations and architecture idealizations.
     b. Leveraging highly advanced human/AI red teams that work symbiotically to attack both systems and intuition with the wworlds most advanced social engineering techniques.
     c. Leveraging generative imagination within human/AI teams to dramatically expand the problem and solution set considered with the attack surface, allowing a probabilistic approach to threats.
8. Leveraging all inputs in cryptographically secure, anonymized ways, to ensure the user is in ultimate control of not just their security but their data, privacy, and transparency.
9. Firewalls based on white listing and continuous review rather than blacklisting, zero trust everything.
10. Homomorphic encryption environments with AI mediated access controls, allowing for an encrypted environment you can virtually "get into" only if allowed by an AI that already exists within that environment, providing impregnable security.

## Idealized proposal:
  A virtualized version of a hardware TPM module using novel cryptographic techniques to establish a secure boot process that is auditable by the user, using multi-party distributed cryptographic operations and threshold cryptography. This would also include auditability and logging, but would balance privacy and transparency.
